Q:What are the improvements you made in Plai's PlayerController?


A:Fixed a couple of bugs related to the controller physics where if you used the script in different hardware with different specs it would have weird results (for example if this script was made on a low end pc and the physics were working fine then compiling the game and sending it to someone else that has a higher end pc they would have completely different physics values therefore making the game unplayable),

Plai divided the player controller mechanics into 4 scripts which would unnecessarily pile up your scripts folder i just merged all of the scripts into one script making it much easier to navigate through.

Make sure to check out the Issues tab to see a fix for an issue you're having and if your issue isnt listed just make an issue and i will make sure to tell you the fix.
